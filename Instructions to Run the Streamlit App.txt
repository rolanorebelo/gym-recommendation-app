Instructions to Run the Streamlit App on Windows

Download and Extract the Project Folder

Download the project folder you shared. If it’s compressed (e.g., .zip), right-click and select "Extract All" to extract it to a folder on your local machine.
Activate the Existing Virtual Environment

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project folder where the .venv folder is located. Use the "cd" command (e.g., cd path-to-extracted-folder).
Activate the virtual environment by typing .venv\Scripts\activate.
Install Dependencies (if needed)

Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt to ensure all dependencies are installed in the virtual environment.
Run the Streamlit App

Start the app by typing streamlit run streamlit_gym_app.py.
A browser window should open automatically, displaying the app. If it doesn’t, copy the local URL provided in the Command Prompt and paste it into your browser.
Stop the App (When Done)

To stop the app, return to the Command Prompt window and press "Ctrl + C".
Deactivate the virtual environment by typing "deactivate".
